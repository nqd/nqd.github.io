I am developing a benchmark framework named Gobench forks at Veriksystems.
What is special about this benchmark? Well, it supports more than just HTTP. We
are having MQTT and NATS. You can also write scenario in Go. And it will be
distributed.

When finished two milestones out of three, I have a small presentation at
[Grokking Vietnam](https://www.grokking.org/) about this benchmark tool. The
following is the slide of the talk.
