My first Alexa smart home skill published

We at [Zinno Inc](zinnoinc.com) has been working with Alexa for our smart home system for about a year. Believing voice control with Alexa is the key feature for home automation, we should submit to Alexa skill store.

The Alexa certificating process is surprisingly easy comparing to, say, Google Assistant (I will publish another blog about this process). The Alexa team is very active too, they usually respond in less than 3 days.

For documentation, we follow the [good guiding](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smarthome/smart-home-skill-publishing-guide.html). As mentioned before, the submitting process is easy:

1. Amazon does not require us to send samples to their certification office like Google.
2. Amazon just requires us an account with one device setup. Though we are supporting hundreds of devices with range category light, outlet, fan, lock, camera. To be fair, we set up a testing account with a number of lights, lock, thermostat.
3. After submitting, we have the result within 3 days. Our first attempt failed because one of our members get the icon from Messenger chatbot which contained Facebook metadata. We updated the icon, resubmitted, and done.

The certification process is free.
