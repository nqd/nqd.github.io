Welcome to my personal site. I am a computer geek and sports lover. I love building distributed systems from tiny embedded chip to the cloud. In free time, I run and swim.

My tools are Golang, Java, Node, C and Linux. 

I work extensively in IoT, communication protocol, real-time system, and web service.

I am working at [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com) to create an open financial system for the world, focusing on the SEA markets.

I worked at [Gopay of Goto group](https://www.gojek.com/en/th/gopay/), one of the largest fintech company in Southeast Asian, where I was an IC maintaining and developing new features for the topup and withdarwal flows.

At [Veriksystems](veriksystems.com), I helped customers bring the next
generation of network devices to the market. My role is develop, architect, manage projects, work with mobile and firmware teams to deliver end-to-end solution to our customers.

At [Zinno](https://zinnoinc.com), I led a backend group of three, built backend for Zwave/Zigbee hub and battery-powered camera. We built
[Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/Zinno-Inc/dp/B07NBMBTXN/) and Google Assistant as the voice interface with the system.

Caring about reliable, maintainable software, I always require my projects to be set up with CI, be driven with TDD, BDD process.

Some open source projects are:
- [gobench](https://github.com/gobench-io/gobench): A distributed benchmark framework that support multiple protocols.
- [esp8266-dev](https://github.com/nqd/esp8266-dev): ESP8266 WiFi SoC development environment, with OTA made easy.
