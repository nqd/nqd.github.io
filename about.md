Welcome to my personal site. I am a computer geek and sports lover. I love
building distributed systems from tiny embedded chip to the cloud. In free time,
I run and swim.

My tools are Golang, NodeJS, Java, C and Linux. In the last few years, I have
been working extensively in the area of IoT, communication protocol, real-time
system, and web service.

I am working at Gopay of Gojek, one of the latest fintech in Southeast Asian.

At Veriksystems, I helped customers bring the next generation of network devices
to the market. My main role is develop, architect, manage projects, work with
mobile and firmware teams to deliver end to end solution to our customers.

At [Zinno](https://zinnoinc.com), I led a backend group of three, built backend
for Zwave/Zigbee hub and battery-powered camera. We built
[Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/Zinno-Inc/dp/B07NBMBTXN/) and Google Assistant as
the voice interface with the system.

Caring about reliable, maintainable software, I always require my projects to be
set up with CI, be driven with TDD, BDD process.

Some past open source projects are:
- [gobench](https://github.com/gobench-io/gobench): A distributed benchmark
  framework that support multiple protocols.
- [esp8266-dev](https://github.com/nqd/esp8266-dev): ESP8266 WiFi SoC
  development environment, with OTA made easy.
